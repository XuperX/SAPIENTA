      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" column="1" id="53" page="1">Interactive smile games between infants and their caregivers mark an important milestone in infant social development and serve as the foundation for later forms of social interaction [ <xref class="deo:Reference" id="15" ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="16" ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Research on mother-infant smile interaction has used statistical methods to describe infant- mother responsivity and turn-taking [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="17" ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" hidden="1" id="18" ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="19" ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. While providing important insights into interactive structure, it remains unclear why mothers and their infants time their smiles as they do. Here we quantify in an objective manner whether the smiles of young infants are purposeful and attempt to discover what their purpose might be. Detecting goals in observed behaviors may provide a deeper understanding of typical social development, and of early-emerging disorders such as autism.<marker number="2" type="page"/><marker type="block"/> The rich literature on smiling in face-to-face interactions between parents and infants under seven months of age is predominantly descriptive [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="25" ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Duration-focused research has documented the tendency of infant and mother smiling to co-occur, but says less about which partner is responsible for the occurrence of joint smiling [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="26" ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="27" ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Research focusing on the frequency of smile onsets indicates that mothers tend to respond to infant smile onsets with a smile of their own [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="28" ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="29" ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="30" ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Infants have a similar though weaker tendency to smile in response to mother smiles. It is unclear, however, how long infants maintain these responsive smiles. The current research offers a comprehensive examination of smiling patterns which integrates the duration and frequency approaches. Smile onsets (and offsets) are investigated with respect to their role in influencing the likelihood of subsequent smiling states character- ized by the durations of their co-occurrences. How should the smiling goals of young infants be investigated? Interactive goals are thought to emerge with the development of intentional communication [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="31" ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" hidden="1" id="32" ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="33" ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Typically, the concerted use of gestures to influence another’s actions—e.g., requesting a toy—constitutes the first evidence of intentional communication [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="34" ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This type of intentional gesturing emerges between 8 and 12 months of age. During this period, infants also begin to show anticipatory smiling in which they gaze at an object, smile, and then turning the already smiling face to look at the mother, which is associated with means–ends gesturing to others [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="35" ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" hidden="1" id="36" ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="37" ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, infants four months of age and under do not use gestures in a concerted fashion to achieve goals, nor do they engage in anticipatory smiling. They do, however, engage in a rich interplay of smiling behavior with their parents. Are these smiles timed in a fashion that tends to pro- duce particular dyadic end states? In the mid 20 th century Norbert Weiner pioneered the development of Cybernetics, whose focus was the mathematical study of purposeful, goal-oriented behavior in animals and machines [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="38" ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. His pioneering work was influential in the development of Control Theory, the formal machinery behind modern robotics and automation [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="39" ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" hidden="1" id="40" ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" hidden="1" id="41" ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="42" ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. A simple case of a controller is a thermostat. Its input is the room temperature and its output is a command for the heating system to turn on or off. The goal (or purpose) of the controller is to keep the room temperature within a desired range. In the current context, goal and purpose refer to hypothesized end states. The question at hand is whether the controller (e.g., the infant or mother) times its actions in a fashion consistent with producing those states. The use of the terms goal and purpose does not imply that the infant or mother are aware of these states. Advances in machine learning and more powerful computers have recently been used to reverse engineer the goals of controllers from their behavior. The use of control theory to reverse-engineer the goals of an agent from observations of its behavior is known as “inverse optimal control” [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="43" ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" hidden="1" id="44" ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="45" ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The inputs to inverse optimal control algorithms are time-stamped sequences of sensory data and observed behaviors (e.g., the temperature of the room and the commands sent by the thermostat). These inputs are used to quantify whether there is evidence that the observed behaviors are goal-oriented and, if so, to infer what the goals are. In inverse optimal control, we typically use the term “agent” to refer to the system whose goals we want to discover, and “plant” to refer to the system that the agent is trying to control. While inverse optimal control algorithms are mathematically and computationally complex, their logic is simple. First, we develop a dynamical model of the plant [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="46" ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. The result is a model that predicts how the plant behaves under different conditions. Second, we formulate a hypothetical goal for the agent whose behavior we are trying to understand. Third, we use control theory [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="47" ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] to find the optimal control policy to achieve the hypothesized goal. Fourth, we determine how closely the agent’s actions match the actions dictated by the optimal policy. We iterate steps two through four over a space of potential goals. If the optimal policy for a particular goal matches the observed actions better than the optimal policies corresponding to the<marker number="3" type="page"/><marker type="block"/> other potential goals, then we conclude that the agent’s actions are directed towards that particular goal. Conversely, if the actions equally match all possible goals, there would be no evidence for goal-directedness on the part of the agent. Here we apply inverse optimal control methods to discover whether infants and mothers time their smiles in a purposeful manner and if so, what their purpose might be. To this end, we model the smile interactions between mothers and infants as a game between two agents where each agent is trying to control a plant (the other agent) to achieve its goals. When analyzing the purpose of the mother’s behavior we treat her as the agent and the infant as the “plant” she is trying to control. When analyzing the purpose of the infant’s behavior we treat the infant as the agent and mother as the “plant” that the infant is trying to control. The four goal states we compared (mother smiling, infant not smiling; infant smiling, mother not smiling; both smiling; neither smiling) represent a logical division of possible dyadic smiling states. To ensure that infants could see mother’s smiles we constrained our analysis to interactive periods in which infants were gazing at mother.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" column="1" id="126" page="7"><s sid="99">The current study provides an innovative and rigorous mathematical analysis of smiling patterns in infants four months of age and younger.</s><s sid="100"> Control theory methods were used to objec- tively ascertain whether observed behaviors were purposeful and to infer their specific purpose.</s><s sid="101"> Mothers timed their smiles to maximize periods of simultaneous smiling with their infants.</s><s sid="102"> By contrast, infants timed their smiles to maximize periods of mother-only smiling.</s><s sid="103"> We found that infant (and mother) timed their smiles in a sophisticated manner that dem- onstrated mastery of the statistics of social interaction.</s><s sid="104"> Both partners timed their smiling to have a systematic impact on the other partner.</s><s sid="105"> We do not claim, however, that either partner was aware of timing their smiles in order to achieve a specific goal.</s><s sid="106"> Although Piaget [ <xref class="deo:Reference" id="105" ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] was explicitly interested in the development of mental representations of goals, modern behavioral researchers are agnostic as to whether the infant is or is not aware of the end state she or he is pursuing [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="106" ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</s><s sid="107"> These results nevertheless suggest that infants leveraged social interaction patterns to achieve specific dyadic states well before there is evidence for conventional use of means-to-ends behavior.</s><s sid="108"> The four goal states we compared (mother smiling, infant not smiling; infant smiling, mother not smiling; both smiling; neither smiling) represent a logical division of possible dyadic smiling states.</s><s sid="109"> However, other goals are possible.</s><s sid="110"> Infants may have dynamic goals such as changing mother’s smiling state (whether or not she is smiling).</s><s sid="111"> Infant goals may also be unmeasured correlates of the goals we examined (such as producing a particular type of mother smile).</s><s sid="112"> Nevertheless, amongst the four compared goals there was clear evidence that some goals were more consonant with the data than others.</s><s sid="113"> To further validate our analysis, we ported the smile timing strategy used by infants into a robot that engaged in smile games with adult humans.</s><s sid="114"> The transplanted smile timing strategy replicated the infant-mother study: it maximized adult-only smiling.</s><s sid="115"> Mothers’ goals of maximizing simultaneous smiling suggest that mutual states of joint positive engagement are highly valued.</s><s sid="116"> These mutual states are likely one of the motivations for mothers’ high levels of smiling responses to infant smile onsets.</s><s sid="117"> The infant goal of maximizing mother-only smiling may be construed in behavioral ecological terms [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="107" ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</s><s sid="118"> The infant smile may signal a desire for affiliative signals from the mother such as smiling.</s><s sid="119"> When mother smiling occurs, the infant smiling signal is no longer required.</s><s sid="120"> It is also possible that infants tend to cease smiling after a mother smile in order to regulate positive affective arousal [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="108" ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</s><s sid="121"> Mothers' and infants' goals differed.</s><s sid="122"> Mothers acted consonant with the goal of increasing mutual smiling while infants acted consonant with the goal of increasing mother-only smiling.</s><s sid="123"> Interaction involves emergent patterns that may differ from those favored by either party.</s><s sid="124"> Common dyadic patterns in infant-mother interaction may, in part, results from the juxtaposi- tion of these different goals.</s><s sid="125"> The goal state that had similar posterior probability values for infant and mother was that in which neither infant or mother were smiling, a statistically com- mon state of affairs in infant-mother interaction [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="109" ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</s><s sid="126"> The conflict between mother and infant goals is relevant to a long-standing debate concerning infant responsivity.</s><s sid="127"> Early theorists were<marker number="8" type="page"/><marker type="block"/> concerned that although infants appeared to alter their behavior in response to their parents, parents tended to time their actions in a fashion that made infant appear to be responsive [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="115" ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</s><s sid="128"> Here we show that infants act in pursuit of goals that differ from parent goals, highlighting the role of the infant as an independent interacting agent.</s><s sid="129"> The study of goals during interaction typically begins with the emergence of intentional gesturing.</s><s sid="130"> Gestures are said to be intentional when they are used as means to an end.</s><s sid="131"> Infants might, for example, extend their arms to request a toy or snack.</s><s sid="132"> Such behavior emerges between 8 and 12 months in typically developing infants [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="116" ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" hidden="1" id="117" ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="118" ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</s><s sid="133"> A similar difficulty exists in understanding manual gesturing to obtain food items observed among orangutans [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="119" ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref class="deo:Reference" id="120" ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and chimpanzees [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="121" ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</s><s sid="134"> The non-human primate literature focuses on the specificity of signal- response associations between two individuals [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="122" ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</s><s sid="135"> Here we build on the logic of signal- response associations using an inverse optimal control framework.</s><s sid="136"> This framework provides a quantitative foundation for pairing signaling actions and responses.</s><s sid="137"> The methods employed here provide support to the idea that by 4 months of age infants smile in a purposive fashion, and clarifies what those purposes are.</s><s sid="138"> The discovery of goal-oriented interactive behavior in infants under six months of age—and the elucidation of the goals underlying those behaviors—could shed light on our understanding of the development of typical and atypical social behavior [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="123" ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</s><s sid="139"> For instance, the approach presented here could be used to analyze the interactive behavior of children who are at high risk for developing autism spec- trum disorders (ASD) [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="124" ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</s><s sid="140"> The analysis could help disambiguate whether young infants who will go on to develop an ASD have more object-oriented and less socially-oriented goals than infants who do not go on to an ASD outcome [<xref class="deo:Reference" id="125" ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</s></region>
